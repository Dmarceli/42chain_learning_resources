<h2 id="Proof of Work">Proof of Work</h2>
<p> Proof of work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks.
 The concept was subsequently adapted to securing digital money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of "reusable proof of work" using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.</p>
<h3>Key-Elements</h3>
  <p>- Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system.</p>
  <p>- Proof of work is used widely in cryptocurrency mining, for validating transactions and mining new tokens.</p>
  <p>- Due to proof of work, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions can be processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner without the need for a trusted third party.</p>
  <p>- Proof of work at scale requires huge amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.</p>
  <p>- Proof of Stake (POS) was one of several novel consensus mechanisms created as an alternative to proof of work.</p>

<h2 id="Proof of Stake">Proof of Stake</h2>
<p>The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have.</p>
<h3>Key-Elements</h3>
<p> - With Proof of Stake (POS), cryptocurrency miners can mine or validate block transactions based on the amount of coins a miner holds.</p>
<p> - Proof of Stake (POS) was created as an alternative to Proof of Work (POW), which is the original consensus algorithm in Blockchain technology, used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain.</p>
<p> - Proof of Work (POW) mining requires huge amounts of energy consumption to fuel computational power; Proof of Stake (PoS) gives mining power based on the percentage of coins held by a miner.</p>
<p> - Proof of Stake (POS) is seen as less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous for the miner.</p>
