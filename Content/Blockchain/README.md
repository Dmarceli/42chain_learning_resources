<h2 id="Blockchain">What is a Blockchain?</h2>
<p> Basically, a Blockchain is a distributed database that is shared in a computer network. The blockchain is used to store information electronically in a secure and decentralized way. It is common related to cryptocurrency systems but can be use for pretty much everything in digital format.</p>
<p> The way a Blockchain is structure is what makes it different from a database. It stores the information in blocks, and when a block is filled, it is added to the chain. In this way, a blockchain is irreversible and everything that is added can't be edited or deleted, so it makes it the most secure way know to store data.</p>
<p> When we say that a Blockchain is decentralized, it means that it is not controlled by a person or a group, rather, all the users of the blockchain collectively retain control. Instead of storing the data in one place only, is it distributed through a network and if someone tries to alter some information in one computer, he will not be able to alter it in the other computers of the network, so the new information can not be altered. If one computer of the network is destroyed, the information is still stored in the network. This makes the Blockchain secure.</p>
<p> To add blocks to a Blockchain, the first step is to input the data (a transaction for example). Then, it is transmitted to the peer-to-peer computers network, that will validate the transaction (solving equations, in the case of Bitcoin, for example). When it is validated as legitimate, the information is clustered in the block and chained together with the previous block of the blockchain.</p><br>
<h3>Why is a Blockchain so Secure?</h3><br>
<p>As exposed before, it is really difficult for someone to hack a Blockchain, altering data of a block for example, but not just because of the decentralization factor.<br>
Each block contains its own hash (mathematical function that converts input of some length to a output of fixed length) and the hash of the previous block and its timestamp. This hash codes are created using a mathematical function to convert data into a string of numbers and letters. This means that if the data is changed in any way, the hash code will be different as well. If someone tries to alter data in a node, that belongs to a copy of the Blockchain, the hash code will no longer be the same as everyone elseâ€™s copy, so that version is not legit.<br>
To be able to change data in a Blockchain, the hacker has to control, simultaneously, at least 51% of the copies of the blockchain, so it becomes the truth, because is the majority. This is incredibly improbable to happen because, even if someone could own 51% of a blockchain, it would require a lot of money and resources to redo all of the blocks with different hash codes and timestamps.

<h2 id="Proof of Work">Proof of Work</h2>
<p> Proof of work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks.
 The concept was subsequently adapted to securing digital money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of "reusable proof of work" using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.</p>
<h3>Key-Elements</h3>
  <p>- Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism that requires members of a network to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the system.</p>
  <p>- Proof of work is used widely in cryptocurrency mining, for validating transactions and mining new tokens.</p>
  <p>- Due to proof of work, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions can be processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner without the need for a trusted third party.</p>
  <p>- Proof of work at scale requires huge amounts of energy, which only increases as more miners join the network.</p>
  <p>- Proof of Stake (POS) was one of several novel consensus mechanisms created as an alternative to proof of work.</p>

<h2 id="Proof of Stake">Proof of Stake</h2>
<p>The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have.</p>
<h3>Key-Elements</h3>
<p> - With Proof of Stake (POS), cryptocurrency miners can mine or validate block transactions based on the amount of coins a miner holds.</p>
<p> - Proof of Stake (POS) was created as an alternative to Proof of Work (POW), which is the original consensus algorithm in Blockchain technology, used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain.</p>
<p> - Proof of Work (POW) mining requires huge amounts of energy consumption to fuel computational power; Proof of Stake (PoS) gives mining power based on the percentage of coins held by a miner.</p>
<p> - Proof of Stake (POS) is seen as less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous for the miner.</p>
