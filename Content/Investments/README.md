<h2 id="Stable">Stablecoins</h2>

<p> Stablecoins are cryptocurriences that are pegged one for one to the value of another asset, in most cases this is a FIAT currency like the USD. Although there are other FIAT currencies they are relatively insignificant in the grand scheme of the stablecoin market.</p> 
<p> Stablecoins are free from the volatility of non-pegged cryptocurrencies, while inheriting some of their most powerful properties:
</p>
<p> Stablecoins are open, global, and accessible to anyone on the internet, 24/7.  
Theyâ€™re fast, cheap and secure to transmit 
theyâ€™re digitally native to the Internet and programmable</p>
<p>There are 3 types of stablecoins:</p>
<p> <b>Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins</b></p>
<p> Fiat-collateralized stablecoins maintain a fiat currency reserve, like the U.S. dollar, as collateral to issue a suitable number of crypto coins. Other forms of collateral can include precious metals like gold or silver, as well as commodities like oil, but most of the present-day fiat-collateralized stablecoins use dollar reserves.</p>
<p> <b>Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins</b></p>
<p> Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Because the reserve cryptocurrency may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are over-collateralizedâ€”that is, a larger number of cryptocurrency tokens is maintained as a reserve for issuing a lower number of stablecoins.</p>
<p> <b>Non-Collateralized (Algorithmic) Stablecoins</b></p>
<p> Non-collateralized stablecoins don't use any reserve but include a working mechanism, like that of a central bank, to retain a stable price. For instance, the dollar-pegged basecoin uses a consensus mechanism to increase or decrease the supply of tokens on a need basis.</p>
<h3> What can you do with stablecoins?</h3>
<p> <strong>Minimize volatility</strong> - The value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether fluctuates a lot â€” sometimes by the minute. An asset thatâ€™s pegged to a more stable currency can give buyers and sellers certainty that the value of their tokens wonâ€™t rise or crash unpredictably in the near future. </p>
<p> <strong> Trade or save assets</strong> - You donâ€™t need a bank account to hold stablecoins, and theyâ€™re easy to transfer. Stablecoinsâ€™ value can be sent easily around the globe, including to places where the U.S. dollar may be hard to obtain or where the local currency is unstable. </p>
<p> <strong>Earn interest</strong> - There are easy ways to earn interest (typically higher than what a bank would offer) on a stablecoin investment.</p>
<p> <strong>Transfer money cheaply</strong> - People have sent as much as a million dollars worth of USDC with transfer fees of less than a dollar.</p>
<p> <strong>Send internationally</strong> - Fast processing and low transaction fees make stablecoins like USDC a good choice for sending money anywhere in the world.</p>
