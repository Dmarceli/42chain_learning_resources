<h2 id="10P">10 Interesting Blockchain Project Ideas for Beginners/Students 2021</h2>
<h3> 1 Blockchain-Based Voting System</h3>
<p> The blockchain-based system can ensure transparent and publicly verifiable elections in the country. If implemented successfully, voting can be done using a mobile application that is attached to a blockchain system. </p>
<h3> 2 Trusted Crowdfunding Platform Using a Smart Contract</h3>
<p> With blockchain technology, investors can know to whom the money is going and how they are spending it. A smart contract helps to block the funds within blockchain until the project or startup founder makes progress in the project.</p>
<h3> 3 Exact Shipment Location Data</h3>
<p> Using blockchain, you can implement a system that collects location data from many interconnected systems and deliver exact location details to the customers. The application of this project can be extended to other areas like airlines to find lost baggage, car rentals for tracking rented car etc.</p>
<h3> 4 Peer To Peer Ridesharing</h3>
<p> If ride-sharing and car hire are moved to the blockchain, without an intermediary, both riders and drivers can get connected directly. If the project is completed successfully, it can build a network that will provide safe, reliable transportation.</p>
<h3> 5 A Fake Product Identification System</h3>
<p> What if the original manufacturer has embedded a 2D barcode on the product which is tied to a blockchain system.
You can scan the 2D barcode using your smartphone, and your smartphone will tell you whether the product is fake or not. </p>
<h3> 6 Transparent and Genuine Charity Application</h3>
<p> The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.</p>
<h3> 7 A Decentralized Web Hosting System</h3>
<p> What if with blockchain, your website doesn’t require a central server? With blockchain, you can split your website content into granules and distribute it all over the internet and then link them together using a blockchain registry.</p>
<h3> 8 Disk Space Renting System</h3>
<p> The idea here is to allow everybody on the planet to rent out their unused disk space which can be attached to a blockchain registry to create a massive worldwide cloud. The idea is similar to the peer-to-peer network, but with blockchain, it’s going to be completely decentralized.</p>
<h3> 9 Loyalty Points Exchange System</h3>
<p> With blockchain, you can implement a project that allows consumers to combine and transparently trade loyalty rewards. </p>
<h3> 10 Trackback Your Food to its Source</h3>
<p> Using blockchain technology, you can implement a system that can help consumers trace back the journey of fresh produce or meat to its source. Thereby, consumers can buy the product with a lot more trust.</p>
